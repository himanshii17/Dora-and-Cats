# Survivor Nobi
Survivor Nobi is an immersive Java-based game developed using the Swing framework and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This game challenges players to navigate through a hazardous environment, facing three menacing spiders as the primary adversaries. The game leverages fundamental concepts of game development, such as collision detection, threading for smooth gameplay, and some animations for an engaging player experience. The graphical user interface (GUI) is meticulously crafted, allowing for intuitive interaction and seamless event handling. Developed in Eclipse, Survivor Nobi also integrates various images to create a visually appealing environment. This project covers essential aspects of game development, including game fundamentals, GUI development, threading, collision detection, player and enemy drawing, animations, game messaging, image handling, and event binding.
